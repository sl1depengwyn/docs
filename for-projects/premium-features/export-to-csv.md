# CSV Exports

Export to CSV is a premium feature providing users a way to easily download and analyze blockchain data. It is available for tabs on the address page including transactions, internal transactions, tokens, and logs.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: simplified CSV exports (transactions and transfers only, with no ability to define time periods) \_\_ exist in Blockscout releases up to 3.5.1. From v3.5.2+ enhanced CSV export is available as a premium feature.
{% endhint %}

_Note:_ under the _Tokens_ tab, the list of token transfers will be exported.

After clicking the button you will be forwarded to a _/csv-export_ page for a given address and given type of export (transactions, internal-transactions, token-transfers, logs).

It is possible to specify an arbitrary period for the data export. By default, the current period is the previous month. After completing the reCaptcha, the data for the chosen period should be exported.
