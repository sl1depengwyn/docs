# Welcome to Blockscout

{% hint style="success" %}
ðŸ”µðŸŽ‰ The first public instance of the newly redesigned Blockscout has been released with the Base testnet! [https://base-goerli.blockscout.com](https://base-goerli.blockscout.com/)\
\
This major update is set to transform open-source blockchain exploration. We will continue improving Blockscout as we approach the mainnet release and additional deployments. [More details about the new BlockScout redesign](about/roadmap/blockscout-2.0.md).
{% endhint %}

Blockscout provides a comprehensive, easy-to-use interface for users to view, confirm, and inspect transactions on EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) blockchains. Blockscout currently supports a wide range of projects and hosts chains such as Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Polygon, Optimism, Gnosis Chain, Celo, Astar, and many more. See our [projects list](about/projects.md) for more details.

While there are several explores available to blockchain projects, most are closed systems (ie Etherscan, Etherchain) which are not independently verifiable. Blockscout provides a much needed open-source alternative. As the multi-chain paradigm continues to take hold in both private and public settings, transparent tools are needed to analyze and validate transactions.

Information on the latest release and version history is available in the [Github repo](https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout/releases).
