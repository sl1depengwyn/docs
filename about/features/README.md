# Features

### **What can I do with Blockscout?**

* **Deep Search**: Find all the information you need on [Blocks](../../for-users/overviews/blocks.md), Transactions, Tags and more through the integrated search box.
* **Interact with Contracts**: [Read and write to contracts](../../for-users/interacting-with-smart-contracts.md) directly from the Blockscout UI.
* **Verify Contracts:**  Use [Hardhat](../../for-users/verifying-a-smart-contract/hardhat-verification-plugin.md), [Sourcify](../../for-users/verifying-a-smart-contract/contracts-verification-via-sourcify.md), and other tools to quickly verify  contracts.
* **Make API Calls**: Make requests to a [robust API](../../for-users/api/) using standard and customized endpoints.
* **Customize Views**: Use the [My Account](../../for-users/my-account/) features to add tags, watchlists and other features.

### **Key Features**
