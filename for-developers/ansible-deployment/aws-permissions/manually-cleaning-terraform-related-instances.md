# Manually Cleaning Terraform Related Instances

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the deployment process was previously successful, you can run  `bin/infra destroy`. Additionally, `bin/infra destroy_setup`will delete the DynamoDB table. [More information on destroying infrastructure is available here](../destroying-provisioned-infrastructure.md).

However, in circumstances that rely on insufficient AWS account rights, the deployment process may fail. In this case, `bin/infra destroy_setup` will not work.&#x20;

**Additionally, forgetting to clean resources can result in high AWS costs in a short period of time, so it's best to check that all resources have been removed.**&#x20;
{% endhint %}

In order to completely manually remove Terraform deployment from AWS you need to clear all related instances of the following services:

* S3
* CodeDeploy
* DynamoDB
* Route 53
* DynamoDB
* VPC
* RDS

### Removing S3 Buckets
