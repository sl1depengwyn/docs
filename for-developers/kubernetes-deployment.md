# Kubernetes Deployment

We've released a Helm chart to deploy Blockscout stack ([backend](https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout), [frontend](https://github.com/blockscout/frontend) and [stats](https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout-rs/tree/main/stats)) to a kubernetes cluster.&#x20;

Baseline instructions are available at [https://github.com/blockscout/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/blockscout-stack](https://github.com/blockscout/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/blockscout-stack).

Additional details coming soon.
