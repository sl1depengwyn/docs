# Transaction Tags

Each transaction on a blockchain has a unique identifier called a hash. The transaction hash is created cryptographically from the details of a transaction such as the sender, receiver, value, additional data, and nonce.

Similar to address tags, transaction tags are useful for specifying and organizing transactions in the Blockscout interface. When logged in, a small grey tag will be added with the chosen name to any tagged transaction.

**1) Login to My Account in Blockscout** <[_login instructions_](./)> to create a tag.

1. Go to Transaction Tags in the user menu.
2. Press Add transaction tag.

1. Transaction. Double check you are entering the correct transaction hash. Search in Blockscout to confirm.
2. Name. Create a name for the tag (35 characters or less). Emojis are a nice way to differentiate and add style and color to tags.
3. Press Save.
